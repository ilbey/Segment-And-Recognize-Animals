# Segment-And-Recognize-Animals

In this project, we designed and developed an algorithm to segment and recognize the animals in images. Our code included two main procedures; 
  
  1) A segmentation algorithm that is able to separate animals in images.
      -Our segmentation algorithm must use both spectral (color, contrast, texture etc.) and spatial (boundaries, shape, size, orientation etc.) information.
      -Our segmentation algorithm not included any image specific solution.
      -Overall performance of your segmentation algorithm computed (by a visual inspection of all images) as the percentage of correctly segmented images.
  
  2) A recognition algorithm to recognize animals using segmentation results. 
      -Our recognition algorithm included training and testing sets. Using validation method (e.g. k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out, hold-out etc.) for this purpose.
      -Our recognition algorithm included classification technique (e.g. knn, na√Øve bayes classifier etc.).
      -The overall performance of your recognition algorithm computed as the total number of correct classification of test images divide by the total number of test images.
